    "- Cost function are also called as loss functions in machone learning\n",
    "- These are optimization techniques(Machine Learning to improve model performance by minimizing error (loss) or maximizing accuracy.)\n",
    "- There are many cost function in machine learning\n",
    "- There are different cost function for regression and classication\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Why Cost Function in Machine Learning\n",
    "- During the training phase , the model assumes the initial weights randomly and tries to make a prediction on training data.\n",
    "- So here how the model gets to know how much \"far\" it was from the prediction?\n",
    "- Model needs this infomation so that it can adjust the weight accodingly (using gradient descent) in the next iteration on training\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 How cost function works ?\n",
    "- Cost Function is a function that takes both predicted outputs and actual outputs from model.\n",
    "- Then it calculates how much error in the model to predict the good results\n",
    "- In next step the model tries to adjust this error for the next iteration on training data to reach optimization level\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 Goal of training \n",
    "- The goal of the training phase is to come up with weights that minimize the error in every iteration\n",
    "- This way of training is required in machine learning to optimize model"

    "- Machine learning is a technique which enables computers to learn automatically from past data\n",
    "- Machine learning is an approach to train the models\n",
    "- Machine learning is helpful to predict the future values\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 model \n",
    "- In simple terms a model is a representationo  of reality\n",
    "- A model is created to do a specific purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "  - General example a world map is a model for this physical world or universe\n",
    "    1. The creator of world map have done deep analysis understands, visualized with simple representation\n",
    "   \n",
    "# In Terms of Machine learning\n",
    "- A model can be a ,\n",
    "  1. A piece of code or program\n",
    "  2. A mathematical formula\n",
    "  3. A program + mathematical formula\n",

    "## 3 Train \n",
    "- We need to train the model\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 How to train .?\n",
    "- We need to use data to Train the model\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5 Model learn\n",
    "- model will learn patter from data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6 Pattern \n",
    "- Patterns means a simple knowledge gained during training\n",
    "- So model learnt patterns from Data During training\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7 Before trained \n",
    "- Before training model , model doesn't know about the patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8 After trained \n",
    "- After training model , model knows about the patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9 Test the model \n",
    "- Once after model got trained then that model has to be tested to check the accuracy\n",
    "- If accuracy is good than the model works well\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10 Model deployment\n",
    "- Finally we need to deploy knowledge acquired by the model\n",
    "- These models also called as model fit\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11 Towards target or classifier\n",
    "- Models learnt patterns from data towards target value\n",
    "- So let try to understand what it means\n",

    "## 12 General example\n",
    "- Assuming that one of my friend is introducing his friend as\n",
    "  1. His name is prasand working in X Compay and having 3 yrs of experience\n",
    "- When I heard about hisexperience I can guess/ predict his salary (target value)\n",
    "- so out brain is already trained to guess some attributes from past data (old friends)\n",
    "- So we have patterns towards to target value\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13 Smart application\n",
    "- once accuracy satisfied then we need to deploy the model\n",
    "- Once model deployed then that application will become as smart application\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14 Normal Application \n",
    "- Assuming that we have created an application by using Java/dotnet/python\n",
    "- It's just called as normal software application because this application is just works on instrution based\n",
    "- Instruct based means\n",
    "  1. If x values is greater than y value then prints x value\n",
    "  2. If x value is less than y value then prints y value\n",
    "## Make a note\n",
    "- Normale application cannot think like human to take decisions\n",
    "- Normale application cannot take own decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15 Smart application\n",
    "- A smart application is an application which thinks like a human to take the decision\n",
    "- Smart application is intelligence based\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16 Use case\n",
    "- Whenever you send email automatically Gmail application is predicting weather it is a spam or not spam\n",
    "- That means Gmail application is well trained and captures the patterns about mail type like\n",
    "  1. Spam mail\n",
    "  2. promotion mail\n",
    "  3. Social media mail & etc\n",
    "- So, Gmail application knows patterns about to recognize the type of mail\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17 Accuracy testing\n",
    "- Before deploying the model it needs to be tested in lot of dimensions\n",
    "- If model is getting good predictions then we need to deploy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process in machine learning\n",
    "- We need to Train the model\n",
    "- During training model acquires the knowledge\n",
    "- This knowledge is called as model fit\n",
    "- Once after model fit produced we need to test to check the accuracy\n",
    "- If satisfied with accuracy then we need to deploy the model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data is important\n",
    "- We need to train the model with data\n",
    "- During this training model will go through the data and understand the patterns about data\n",
    "- These patterns helps to predict the result on new data"

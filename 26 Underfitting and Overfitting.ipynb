    "## 1 Overfitting & Underfitting \n",
    "- The main goal of every machine learning model is to generalize well\n",
    "- A generalized model provides a suitable output on unknown dataset\n",
    "  - This means after providing training on the dataset, it can produce reliable and accurate output\n",
    "- Overfitting and underfitting are two main problems that occur in machine learning because of these ML model performances may impact to reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Noise\n",
    "- Noise means irrelevant data; it reduces the performance of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 Bias \n",
    "- Difference between the predicted values and the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 Variance\n",
    "- Machine learning model performs will with the training dataset but does not perform well with the test dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5 Overfitting \n",
    "- Overfitting is the scenario where a machine learning model cannot generalize or fit well on unseen dataset\n",
    "- The over fitted model has low bias and high variance\n",
    "# Note \n",
    "- We can avoid the overfitting in model by using cross-Validation , training with more data, removing feature regularization , Ensemble\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6 Underfitting \n",
    "- During training if model unable to learn properly then this called as underfitting.\n",
    "- So it reduces the accuracy and produces unreliable predictions.\n",
    "- The under fitted model has high bias and low variance\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7 Good fit model\n",
    "- If model predicts well on training dataset and unseen dataset then it's called as good fit model\n",

    "- During training the model is giving good score\n",
    "- During testing the model is giving good score\n",

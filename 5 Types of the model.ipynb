    "### 1.1 Features\n",
    "- Feature are simply the columns of the table\n",
    "- These feature describes the about the data\n",
    "- In the given data, Age , Gender , Experience and salary are features\n",
    "\n",
    "| Age | Gender | Experience | Salary |\n",
    "|-----|--------|------------|--------|\n",
    "| 20  | M      | 4          | 40000  |\n",

    "### 1.2 Label\n",
    "- The output we will get after training the model is called as Label\n",
    "- Requirement\n",
    "  - Suppose I wanted to predict the salary who had 6 years of experience\n",
    "  - We prepared a model and that model predicted the salary\n",
    "  - Here salary is called as a label\n",
    "- Simple\n",
    "  - We a tring to predict a feature based on the others, that feature is the label\n",
    " \n",
    "## 2 label Example\n",
    "- If we are trying to predict the type of pet for example cat or dog based on information then that is the label\n",
    "- If we are trying to predict if the pet is sick or healthy based on symptoms and other infomation then that is the label.\n",
    "- If we are trying to predict the age of the pet then the age is the label\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 Labelled and unlabeled data  (very veryy imp interview)\n",
    "- According to the label data is divided into two types\n",
    "  - Labelled data\n",
    "  - Unlabeled data\n",
    "## 3.1 Labelled Data\n",
    "- Labelled data comes with a tag or label , like a name , a type , or a number\n",
    "## 3.2 Unlabeled Data\n",
    "- Labelled data have no tag or label\n",
    "\n",

    "## 4 Supervised learning definition \n",
    "- In Supervised learning We will train the models by using input features and labels\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5 Unsupervised Learning definition\n",
    "- In unsupervised learning we will train the models by using only input features and there is not labels\n",
    "- ## Unsupervised machine learning by unsuperisted learning groups your data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6 Supervied learning example\n",
    "- Now a day it is very commonly  using for all applications\n",
    "- Supervised learning = feature + label\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "  - Image recognition\n",
    "  - Test processing\n",
    "  - Recommendation system & many more\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "- In previous image we have an image we have an image data about dogs and cates\n",
    "- Labels in the image are dog and cat\n",
    "- The machine learning model use previous data in order to predict the label of new data points\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7 Remember - formulate - Predict\n",
    "- Supervised learning works in remember - formulate - predict\n",
    "- The model first remembers the dataset of dogs and cate\n",
    "- Then model formulates a model for what is a dog and what is a cat\n",
    "- Whenever a new image comes in the model makes a prediction about what the label of the image weather cat or dog\n",

    "## 8 Types of Supervised learning models (very imp interview )\n",
    "- Supervised learning models are divided into two types\n",
    "  ### - Regression models  => Predict nuber , example sales==numbers,age==number\n",
    "  ### - Classification models => predict classify/class/category ex person==male/female , rain == yes/no,image==cat/dog\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Regression models\n",
    "- Regression models used to predict a number\n",
    "- The output of a regression model is a continuous since the prediction can be any real value\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Weight of the animal\n",
    "  - Employee salary\n",
    "  - Students marks\n",
    "  - Stock market\n",
    "  - Number of sales\n",
    "  - Predicting price of house & etc\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 Classification models\n",
    "- These are the types of models that predict the class or state\n",
    "- Examples\n",
    "  - Types of animal (cat or dog)\n",
    "  - Types of human being means male or female\n",
    "  - Biryani taste: good or bad or not good\n",
    "  - Mail id spam or ham\n",
    "\n",
    "# Regression\n",
    "- What is the temperature going to be tomorrow ? => 84\n",
    "# CLassification\n",
    "- Will it be cold or hot tomorrw ? Cold/hot\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9 Unsupervised learning example\n",
    "- It groups of the data based on similaries\n",
    "- In unsupervied learning we will train the models by using only input features but there are no labels\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning is grouping the data based on similarities\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10 Types of Unsupervised learning models (very imp )\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning models are divided into two types\n",
    "  1. Clustering\n",
    "  2. Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1 Clustering\n",
    "- This is the task of grouping our data into clusters based on similarity by colour , by shape , by size\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.2 Dimensionality reduction\n",
    "- Dimension means => coloumn name\n",
    "- Reduction means => delect or remove to get good preformance\n",
    "- This is task of simplifying our data and describing it with fewer features, without losing much generlity\n",
    "- The dimensionality reduction algorithms will finds ways that group them losing as little infomation as possible"

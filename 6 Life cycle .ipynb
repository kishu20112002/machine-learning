    "### 1.1 Data Collection\n",
    "- Data Gathering is the first step in machine learning life cycle\n",
    "- In this step We need to identify the different data sources  (csv files,excel file clood file)\n",
    "- Data Can be collected from differnt sources such as files , database , web & etc\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Data Prepartion \n",
    "- During data preparation we should understand about the data format quality of data & ect\n",
    "- A better understanding of data leads to an effective outcome\n",
    "- We will find correiations , general trends and outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Data Wrangling\n",
    "- Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and converting raw data into a useable formate\n",
    "- It is the process of\n",
    "  1. Cleaning the data\n",
    "  2. Missing values\n",
    "  3. Duplicate data\n",
    "  4. Invalid data\n",
    "  5. Selecting the variable to use\n",
    "- It is not necessary that data we have collected is always of our use as some of the data may not be useful\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Train the model\n",
    "- During training the model can learn different patterns and rules\n",
    "- We need to use train dataset to train the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Test the model\n",
    "- Once model trainied then testing is required to check the accuracy\n",
    "- We need to use test dataset to test the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.6 Model deployment\n",
    "- Once model trained and tested if model is producing good results then we can deploy the model in the real time "

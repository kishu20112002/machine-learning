Machine Learning Fundamentals Completed 🚀 This repository contains my hands-on implementations of core Machine Learning algorithms, including Linear and Logistic Regression, Tree-based models, SVM, and Clustering techniques. These projects helped me understand model building, training, and evaluation using real datasets.
